          Welcome to The Museum of Royce the Great, Wirehaired Wonder—a tribute honoring a dog whose legacy transcends mere hunting prowess. Royce was often described as more human than canine, possessing a profound, soulful gaze that seemed capable of peering directly into one's innermost thoughts. Renowned as the most exceptional hunting dog of his century, Royce combined unparalleled patience on point, an extraordinary sense of smell, tireless determination in tracking, and a gentle, precise retrieving ability—a rare fusion of skills. Yet it was not merely these remarkable hunting qualities that immortalized Royce. With gentle nose nudges and his reassuring head resting softly upon knees, Royce subtly encouraged the Double Lakes Clan toward growth, compassion, and resilience. He inspired them to become better versions of themselves, leaving an indelible mark upon their lives. In doing so, Royce didn't just change his clan; he empowered them to shape history, forever binding their legacy with his own.
