            <h3>Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Material</dt><dd>Western red cedar body, twisted cedar bark cord, faint traces of spruce resin that still hold a ghost of a forest scent if warmed in the hand.</dd>
              <dt>Size/Weight/Shape</dt><dd>9.1 cm × 1.6 cm; ~14 g; slender, tapered tube with a whisper-thin mouth opening.</dd>
              <dt>Estimated Age</dt><dd>Precise dating is still under review; the piece is currently undergoing high-resolution stratigraphic scanning and isotope analysis by a joint team of preservation scientists and chronometry specialists to narrow its origin down to the exact year—and possibly even the month—of creation. <strong>Estimated completion:</strong> April 17, 2026.</dd>
              <dt>Preservation State</dt><dd>Complete; cedar shows faint surface checking; cord frayed at the knot as though repeatedly untied and retied in haste.</dd>
              <dt>Location Found</dt><dd>Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2, 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments.</dd>
              <dt>Use and Function</dt><dd>Acoustic signal device.</dd>
              <dt>Likely Purpose</dt><dd>To send precise, far-carrying commands to working dogs navigating open water or weaving through dense reed beds.</dd>
              <dt>Evidence of Use</dt><dd>Smooth lip polish on the mouth end; two shallow tooth nicks just below the notch; burnished suspension groove worn glossy from years of swinging at a handler’s side.</dd>
              <dt>Manufacture Clues</dt><dd>Central channel hand-bored; knife-cut notch clean but slightly asymmetrical; lathe-smoothed exterior faintly ridged where the grain resisted.</dd>
              <dt>Found With</dt><dd>Leather strap fragment, copper button stamped with a worn hunting motif, seed husks likely from dockside grain sacks.</dd>
              <dt>Burial or Habitat Context</dt><dd>Collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris — possibly from a shoreline homestead.</dd>
              <dt>Symbolism</dt><dd>Plain, utilitarian form meant for work; to those who know, the first trill after a long day’s hunt can carry as much emotion as any spoken word.</dd>
              <dt>Comparison</dt><dd>Similar to rural handmade whistles documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits; personal tooth marks make this one unique.</dd>
