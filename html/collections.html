          <h2>Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h2>
          <p class="meta">Material: Western red cedar body, twisted cedar bark cord, faint traces of spruce resin that still hold a ghost of a forest scent if warmed in the hand.</p>
          <p><b>Size/Weight/Shape:</b> 9.1 cm × 1.6 cm; ~14 g; slender, tapered tube with a whisper-thin mouth opening.</p>
          <p><b>Estimated Age:</b> Precise dating is still under review; the piece is currently undergoing high-resolution stratigraphic scanning and isotope analysis by a joint team of preservation scientists and chronometry specialists to narrow its origin down to the exact year—and possibly even the month—of creation. Estimated Completion Date for Analysis: April 17, 2026.</p>
          <p><b>Preservation State:</b> Complete; cedar shows faint surface checking; cord frayed at the knot as though repeatedly untied and retied in haste.</p>
          <p><b>Location Found:</b> Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2, 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments.</p>
          <p><b>Use and Function:</b> Acoustic signal device.</p>
          <p><b>Likely Purpose:</b> To send precise, far-carrying commands to working dogs navigating open water or weaving through dense reed beds — the sort of whistle a handler could lift without breaking stride.</p>
          <p><b>Evidence of Use:</b> Smooth lip polish on the mouth end; two shallow tooth nicks just below the notch — telltale signs of an eager retriever trying to “help” — and a burnished suspension groove worn glossy from years of swinging at a handler’s side.</p>
          <p><b>Manufacture Clues:</b> Central channel hand-bored; knife-cut notch clean but slightly asymmetrical; lathe-smoothed exterior faintly ridged where the grain resisted.</p>
          <p><b>Found With:</b> Leather strap fragment, copper button stamped with a worn hunting motif, seed husks likely from dockside grain sacks.</p>
          <p><b>Burial or Habitat Context:</b> Collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris — possibly from a shoreline homestead.</p>
          <p><b>Symbolism:</b> While undecorated, the whistle’s plain form suggests it was meant for work, not show — yet to those who know, the first trill after a long day’s hunt can carry as much emotion as any spoken word.</p>
          <p><b>Comparison:</b> Similar in form to rural handmade whistles documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits, though the tooth marks make this one unmistakably personal.</p>

          <p><b>Estimated Age:</b> Precise dating is still under review; the piece is currently undergoing high-resolution stratigraphic scanning and isotope analysis… Estimated Completion Date for Analysis: September 3, 2026.</p>
          <p><b>Preservation State:</b> Partial; one ear worn down to its stitching; seam loss along the right flank revealing moss stuffing; pigments faint but still discernible in low light.</p>
          <p><b>Location Found:</b> Cabin 1 attic, hidden in a floorboard cavity 4 cm below a plank gap, as though deliberately tucked away for safekeeping.</p>
          <p><b>Use and Function:</b> Child’s toy — likely cherished in both play and quiet comfort.</p>
          <p><b>Likely Purpose:</b> To represent the family’s Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, serving as a stand-in during hunts or long working days when the real companion was absent.</p>
          <p><b>Evidence of Use:</b> Worn muzzle where countless fingers have rubbed; faded pigment on the flanks where it may have been hugged tightly; a faint scent of old smoke embedded in the hide from years near a hearth.</p>
          <p><b>Manufacture Clues:</b> Hand-cut deerskin with uneven edges; sinew thread intact in places; pigments applied in short strokes to suggest wiry fur texture.</p>
          <p><b>Found With:</b> Two smooth game stones, a splintered clay bead, a woven grass cord fragment, and graphite doodles of what might be a stick figure walking a dog.</p>
          <p><b>Burial or Habitat Context:</b> Dry, dust-sealed cavity with minimal insect activity; insulated from temperature swings by surrounding timbers.</p>
          <p><b>Symbolism:</b> Embodied the spirit of the family’s hunting partner — both a talisman for success and a comfort object for children awaiting safe returns.</p>
          <p><b>Comparison:</b> Parallels found in other pre-contact and early settler-era zoomorphic toys, though the Griffon-specific detailing is rare, suggesting a personal rather than commercial origin.</p>

          <p><b>Manufacture Clues:</b> Even-gauge hand knitting; huckleberry dye unevenness suggests a small-batch, natural process, with darker streaks where berry juice soaked deeper into the wool.</p>
          <p><b>Found With:</b> Splintered stick, small river stone, broken clay cup handle.</p>
          <p><b>Burial or Habitat Context:</b> Domestic floor collapse; charred timbers overhead; cool, low-light preservation conditions.</p>
          <p><b>Symbolism:</b> Possibly none to human owner; to the dog, the sock’s familiar scent, softness, and shape may have been irresistible—a portable joy he could carry in his mouth, much like hunting dogs do when proudly retrieving their prize.</p>
          <p><b>Comparison:</b> Similar in gauge and fiber to other early-settler socks found at frontier homesteads, though unique for clear evidence of canine interaction.</p>

            <div class="history-facts">
              <strong>Artifact ID:</strong> ARC-D2-WHI-001 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Material:</strong> Western red cedar; twisted cedar-bark cord; traces of spruce resin &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Function:</strong> Acoustic signal device &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Location:</strong> Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2 (32–36 cm)
            </div>
            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Material choice. Western red cedar was a practical local wood: light, easy to carve, strong for its weight, and naturally rot- and insect-resistant because of its oils. A twisted cedar-bark cord is common field gear—flexible, quick to knot, and durable when wet. Trace spruce resin on the surface likely acted as a simple sealant or pitch stiffener at the mouth notch; it also helps shed water.</p>
            <p>Why a whistle at all. Working handlers need to direct dogs across distance, wind, and reeds where hand signals and speech fail. A whistle carries farther than a voice, is less tiring, and gives repeatable cues that any trained dog can learn. It also lets a handler keep both hands free for oars, rope, or game.</p>
            <p>How this one was used. Wear patterns are clear: smooth polish at the lip from frequent playing; a glossy suspension groove from long belt or neck carry; and two shallow tooth marks just below the notch from brief canine contact during retrieval or excitement. The tapered tube and hand-bored airway produce a bright, penetrating tone useful over water. The slightly off-center, knife-cut notch favors fast response over decoration—consistent with field use where seconds matter.</p>
            <p>Benefits in the field. Standardized sound codes reduce errors (e.g., “turn,” “hold,” “come”). Dogs hear high pitches well; a small whistle produces those pitches with little breath. The object is cheap to make, easy to repair, and quiet to carry.</p>
            <p>Design and known variants. This example is a simple notched tube: tapered cedar body, single airway, single tone. Regional comparanda include wood or bone tube whistles (single tone; closest match to this piece); “pea” whistles (wood or metal with a small ball that creates a trill; later/modern); and dual-chamber whistles (two tones for more complex codes; usually later and often metal or plastic). Compared with those, this whistle’s minimalist design is typical of earlier, handmade working gear—durable, easy to keep dry, and loud enough for shoreline work.</p>
            <p>Context. Associated finds—a leather strap fragment, a copper hunting-motif button, and grain seed husks—fit a provisioning/hunting setting near water. The find layer (collapsed bank with domestic debris) supports ordinary loss rather than ceremonial discard.</p>
            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Dimensions, taper, and notch geometry match handmade Pacific Northwest hunting whistles. This specimen differs by its combined evidence set: (1) paired dental impressions below the notch, (2) deep suspension-groove burnish, and (3) surviving resin traces. Few reference pieces preserve all three, indicating a long, practical service life with a specific handler–dog team rather than generic or unused equipment.</p>
            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Pitch, signal vocabulary, and training routines cannot be reconstructed directly from the object. Non-canine signaling (e.g., to people) is possible but less supported by the context. Absolute dating and cultural assignment remain provisional pending the ongoing stratigraphic and isotope analyses (report expected April 17, 2026). Interpretations may change with new data.</p>

              <strong>Artifact ID:</strong> ARC-C1-DOL-001 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Material:</strong> Hand-tanned deerskin; sinew; moss + shed canine undercoat; river-stone eyes; ochre/charcoal &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Function:</strong> Child’s toy &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Location:</strong> Cabin 1 attic, floorboard cavity (4 cm)
            </div>
            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Material choice. Deerskin was locally obtainable, soft to handle, and durable at seams; hand-tanning leaves residual oils that resist cracking. Sinew provides high tensile strength when dry and can be re-tightened with moisture—ideal for small stitches. Moss is light, cleanable, and readily packed; adding shed dog undercoat increases loft and retains a familiar household scent. River stones are smooth, non-splintering eye elements. Ochre/charcoal pigments were common, safe colorants for simple patterning.</p>
            <p>Why a doll at all. In working households, a dog was both tool and companion. A small zoomorphic doll allows a child to model handling routines (stay, settle, heel), provides comfort during hunts or long work days, and represents family identity—“our dog”—without risk or cost.</p>
            <p>How this one was used. Wear is concentrated at the muzzle and flanks (rubbing and hugging). One ear is worn to its stitching; a side seam has opened to reveal moss, consistent with extended handling rather than display. A faint smoke odor indicates long residence near a hearth. The object was deliberately hidden 4 cm below an attic floor gap, a common child cache or safekeeping tactic.</p>
            <p>Benefits in daily life. The doll is light, portable, and quiet; it survives falls and rough play better than clay figures. The undercoat likely preserved a recognizable scent, reinforcing attachment and making the object calming during separation from the working dog.</p>
            <p>Design and known variants. Construction is a panel-stitched leather form with seated posture and slight head tilt. Regional comparanda include rag or textile dolls (cloth panels, plant-fiber stuffing); cornhusk figures (braided husks, plant-dye markings); and leather-stuffed animals (deerskin or elk hide, moss/hair fill). This specimen’s Griffon-specific detailing (short pigment strokes suggesting wiry coat; river-stone eyes with mica glint) is atypical of generic farm toys and implies reference to a particular household dog.</p>
            <p>Context. Associated items in the cavity—two smooth game stones, a splintered clay bead, a short woven-grass cord, and graphite doodles of a person walking a dog—fit a child activity zone rather than storage of valuables. The dry, dust-sealed attic insulated the object from insects and temperature swings, explaining the good pigment survival.</p>
            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Parallels exist among early settler zoomorphic toys, but this example differs on three counts: (1) species-specific styling consistent with a Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, (2) scent-linked stuffing using shed canine undercoat, and (3) deliberate concealment context in a child’s cache. Together these point to a personalized object tied to a named working dog rather than a generic trade toy.</p>
            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Owner age, gender, and exact making circumstances are unknown. The undercoat may derive from grooming waste rather than ritual inclusion. While function as a child’s toy is well supported by wear and context, secondary roles (talisman, keepsake after an animal’s death) cannot be confirmed. Absolute dating remains under review (report expected Sep 3, 2026); all cultural attributions are provisional pending laboratory results.</p>

              <strong>Material:</strong> Hand-spun wool; huckleberry dye; nettle-fiber reinforcement &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Function:</strong> Clothing (sock) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Location:</strong> Hearthside debris layer, Cabin Site 2 (12–18 cm)
            </div>
            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Material choice. Hand-spun wool was the standard cold-weather textile: warm, elastic, and repairable. Huckleberry skins provide an accessible plant dye; uneven, streaked uptake is typical of small-batch vats without metallic mordants. Nettle fiber is strong and abrasion-resistant, making it a sensible reinforcement for heel and toe—known stress points.</p>
            <p>Primary function. Everyday clothing. The intact heel and packed wool along the instep indicate long wear inside a shoe or boot. Dye mottling from repeated wet-dry cycles is consistent with winter use.</p>
            <p>Secondary use-life. Damage signatures shift later: a stretched cuff from tugging, wide frays at the toe, and punctures arranged in semicircles. Pattern and spacing fit canine dentition better than rodent gnaw. Faint muddy paw prints on the instep confirm handling by a dog, likely during play or retrieval.</p>
            <p>Benefits in daily life. Wool insulates when damp; a single sock is simple to mend; and natural dyes allow home production. As a toy, a worn sock carries household scent, explaining its attraction to a working or young dog and the “tug” wear observed.</p>
            <p>Design and known variants. Even-gauge knitting with reinforced heel/toe is typical of settler households. Regional comparanda include plain-undyed wool socks (coarser gauge; no reinforcement); plant-dyed socks using berry, bark, or lichen baths; and patterned socks (two-color motifs; rarer in frontier contexts). This specimen is distinguished by the dye streaking characteristic of small vessels and by clear canine interaction marks, which are uncommon in curated textile finds.</p>
            <p>Context. Recovered from a hearthside debris layer at Cabin Site 2 within a domestic floor collapse with charred timbers—conditions that produced cool, low-light preservation. Associated finds (splintered stick, small river stone, broken clay cup handle) match household refuse rather than ritual deposition.</p>
            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Fiber type and knit gauge match other early-settler socks from regional collections. Two features set this object apart: (1) diagnostic canine tooth punctures paired with a stretched cuff indicative of tugging, and (2) huckleberry dye variegation showing small-batch processing. Together they document a transition from garment to informal canine play object—rarely recorded so clearly in textiles.</p>
            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>While the puncture pattern is consistent with a dog, limited lab work leaves a small possibility of multi-agent damage. Dye identification is based on macroscopic color and contextual notes; chromatographic confirmation is pending. Absolute dating remains under review (report expected Feb 11, 2027). Interpretations may be revised as analysis proceeds.</p>

            <h3>Cluster of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Puppy Teeth</h3>
            <div class="history-facts">
              <strong>Artifact ID:</strong> ARC-K3-PT-001 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Material:</strong> Deciduous canine & incisor crowns (enamel/dentine/cementum) in fine loam with spruce-needle traces &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Function:</strong> Biological remains &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Location:</strong> Sunken kennel foundation, Site K-3 (8–12 cm)
            </div>
            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Material and biology. These are naturally shed deciduous teeth from a young dog. Puppy enamel is hard and glossy; thin cementum at the root end may remain when a tooth falls out. The presence of crowns with faint root remnants fits the normal transition to adult dentition.</p>
            <p>Why these appear on sites. Puppies shed teeth between ~3–6 months of age. Teeth are small, easily lost during play, chewing, or mouthing. In kennel or bedding areas, they accumulate where animals rest.</p>
            <p>Use/function. Not a tool or ornament—these are biological remains of routine tooth replacement.</p>
            <p>Wear and taphonomy. Microscopic linear striations on occlusal/labial surfaces match chewing on fibrous plants or small bones. Low micro-pitting and clean cementum margins indicate gentle, in-place deposition rather than trampling.</p>
            <p>Deposition and context. The cluster was recovered at Site K-3 on the edge of a sunken kennel foundation, 8–12 cm deep in compact bedding soil. Associated finds—matted undercoat fur, a short stick worn smooth at both ends, and a fragment of woven reed mat—are typical of a bedding/play zone. Low moisture, shelter, and limited freeze–thaw cycles explain the exceptional preservation.</p>
            <p>Interpretive value. A tight scatter (~6.2 cm) suggests the teeth were shed near a favored resting spot rather than distributed by cleaning or runoff. Together with undercoat and chew-stick evidence, the cluster documents a brief developmental window in a working dog household.</p>
            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Comparable modern and archaeological finds often yield isolated deciduous teeth. In contrast, this intact in-situ cluster with bedding indicators (fur clump, smoothed chew stick, reed-mat fragment) is uncommon. The preservation state (glossy enamel, minimal micro-pitting) and compact scatter strengthen the interpretation of a kennel bedding context rather than general yard or midden deposition.</p>
            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Individual identity and exact litter size cannot be determined from the cluster alone; multiple pups may be represented. Micro-striations are consistent with chewing but are not species-exclusive to plant or bone substrates. Absolute dating remains under review (report expected Nov 8, 2026) based on sediment micro-layering and trace-element analysis. Conclusions may be revised with new data.</p>

            <h3>Partial Human Hand and Distal Radius</h3>
            <div class="history-facts">
              <strong>Artifact ID:</strong> ARC-C7-HND-001 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Material:</strong> Human cortical bone; soil mineral staining &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Function:</strong> Anatomical remains &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Location:</strong> Beneath east threshold stone, Cabin Site 7 (44–52 cm)
            </div>
            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Anatomy and properties. These are adult human hand bones and the distal end of the radius. Cortical bone (the dense outer layer) resists bending and preserves surface micro-wear. Mineral staining and fine soil concretions are typical for compact silty clay.</p>
            <p>Use-related signals. Along the radial sides of the metacarpals, shallow, linear micropolish forms a narrow track—consistent with repeated low-friction contact by skin or hair. On the distal radius, there is mild osteophytic lipping and subtle remodeling at tendon attachment points. The pattern indicates long-term, low-load, repetitive flexion–extension rather than heavy or asymmetric labor. Combined, these features fit a habitual, forward, low-elevation hand motion (e.g., stroking at knee height) more than tool grasping or forceful grip.</p>
            <p>Context and deposition. The elements were recovered beneath the east threshold stone of Cabin Site 7 at 44–52 cm depth in compact silty clay—stable temperature and humidity; minimal rodent disturbance. Threshold placement is a purposeful, protected location that often marks a liminal boundary (entry/exit) in domestic spaces. Associated finds (wool cuff fragment, small bronze button, leather sliver with buckle remnant) indicate ordinary clothing rather than funerary goods.</p>
            <p>Why this matters. Occupational stress markers (weaving, archery, smithing) usually produce joint asymmetries and enthesophytes with load signatures different from those observed here. The polish track and mild, evenly distributed changes align with routine, gentle contact repeated over years. In a household with working dogs, a stroking/patting behavior is a plausible driver for the specific polish location and motion range, though it cannot be proven as the sole cause.</p>
            <p>Preservation notes. No burning; no major fragmentation. Fine cracking along phalangeal shafts is typical age-related or burial microfracture. Surface detail is adequate for microscopy and future histology if needed.</p>
            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Reference collections show task-specific patterns: weavers often present metacarpophalangeal changes with different polish orientation; archers display unilateral remodeling at the forearm consistent with draw/brace asymmetry; smiths show localized enthesopathies at power-grip insertions. The bilateral-neutral, low-load signal and narrow radial-side polish track on metacarpals observed here are uncommon in those categories. A small number of domestic-context cases with “contact polish” from frequent animal handling provide the closest analogs, though published examples remain rare.</p>
            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Individual identity, sex, and handedness are not established. The polish track indicates repeated contact but is not activity-exclusive; textiles, fur, or repetitive household tasks could contribute. Absolute dating is under review (combined osteometrics and U–Th approach; report expected Jun 14, 2027). Interpretations remain provisional pending lab results and any additional context from the cabin stratigraphy.</p>

              <strong>Artifact ID:</strong> ARC-E3-FEM-001 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Material:</strong> Cortical bone (hydroxyapatite + Type I collagen) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Function:</strong> Anatomical remains &nbsp;|&nbsp;
              <strong>Location:</strong> Riverbank erosion face, Site E-3 (silt-and-root alcove)
            </div>
            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Anatomy and properties. Single right (likely) femur, length 19.0 cm, slight anteroposterior curvature, ~110 g. The cortical shell is intact with minor surface weathering; no cut marks, percussion scars, or burning observed. Gnawing on the distal epiphysis consists of small, shallow scoops consistent with light scavenger activity. Faint root etching along the midshaft indicates contact with growing vegetation during burial.</p>
            <p>Function/status. Anatomical remain; no evidence of modification for tool use or ornament. Morphometrics place the element within the range of a medium–large domestic dog (≈25–30 kg); proportions are compatible with Wirehaired Pointing Griffon reference sets.</p>
            <p>Context and deposition. Recovered from a riverbank erosion face (Site E-3), nestled in a shallow silt-and-root alcove beneath overhanging alder. Sediment is a mixed fluvial/colluvial horizon over compact sand—an environment where bones can be reworked by seasonal bank slumps. Orientation (facing downstream) and shelter under roots could result from either deliberate placement or low-energy redeposition.</p>
            <p>Associated finds. A smooth river stone with a single shallow groove (possible handstone wear), a plaited leather cord fragment with frayed end, and a bronze bead comparable to fittings seen on historical canine collars from the Royce era. Together these reinforce a domestic-dog context but stop short of proving individual identity.</p>
            <p>Interpretive value. The specimen documents the presence of a sizeable working dog in the riverine household economy. Lack of butchery marks argues against kitchen waste; light gnawing and root etching chart a short sequence of exposure, minor scavenger attention, then quiet burial in a protected niche.</p>
            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Regional collections show similar femoral lengths and shaft curvatures in 25–30 kg sporting and working breeds. Unlike common midden finds, this piece lacks cut/burn signals and appears with collar-adjacent material (bronze bead, cord). That association is unusual for random shoreline redeposition and is more often seen in curated or carefully placed animal remains, though the fluvial setting prevents a firm conclusion.</p>
            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Attribution to a specific dog or lineage (e.g., “Royce”) is not supportable without broader skeletal association, DNA, or diagnostic artifacts directly fixed to the bone. Fluvial processes may rework both bone and associated items. Absolute dating is under review via stratigraphic scanning and isotope analysis (report expected Nov 14, 2029). Morphometric matches are probabilistic, not definitive; conclusions remain provisional pending laboratory results.</p>

    <h2 id="modal-title">Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Apr 17, 2026) | Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2 | Western red cedar with spruce resin</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Western red cedar body; twisted cedar-bark cord; faint traces of spruce resin</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Acoustic signal device (working whistle)</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments; collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris</p>
    <p>This compact cedar whistle reads like a field diary written in wear. The polished mouth end marks where a handler’s lips met wood thousands of times; the two shallow tooth nicks hint at an eager retriever “helping” between casts. A glossy suspension groove shows years of swinging at a hip, ready for a quick trill that cut through wind and reed-rustle. Warmed in the hand, the faint spruce-resin scent still carries a memory of shoreline forest</p>
    <p>Craft details point to practiced pragmatism: a hand-bored channel for bright, focused tone; a clean, slightly off-center notch that favors speed over ornament. Comparable forms are documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits, yet the tooth marks and specific groove wear make this piece unmistakably personal. As with all sound tools, function is inferred from form and use-wear; interpretation remains provisional until laboratory dating is complete.</p>

    <h2 id="modal-title">Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Doll</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Sep 3, 2026) | Cabin 1 attic, floorboard cavity</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-tanned deerskin panels stitched with sinew; stuffed with dried moss and shed undercoat from a real dog; eyes of polished river stones flecked with mica; detailing in natural ochre and charcoal</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Child’s toy</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Hidden 4 cm below a plank gap in a dry, dust-sealed attic cavity; insulated from temperature swings with minimal insect activity</p>
    <p>Wear on this doll maps the places small hands returned to most: a softened, shiny muzzle;  a breath of old hearth smoke woven into the hide. The figure likely stood in for an absent working partner during long hunt days, a portable companion that kept watch from a bedside or tucked pocket. The discovery context, deliberately stowed in a protected floor gap, suggests someone hid it for safekeeping, or for the bittersweet hope of finding it again.</p>
    <p>Craft traces show practiced, loving economy: hand-cut deerskin with uneven edges; neat sinew stitches that still hold in places; short pigment strokes to suggest wiry fur; moss peeking through a seam opened by years of use.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Sock -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-sock" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Huckleberry-Dyed Woolen Sock of Joy</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Feb 11, 2027) | Hearthside debris layer, Cabin Site 2</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-spun wool dyed with crushed huckleberry skins and rainwater; toe and heel reinforced with nettle-fiber thread</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Clothing (sock)</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 12–18 cm depth; domestic floor collapse with charred timbers; cool, low-light preservation conditions</p>
    <p>This sock carries two lives in one object. As clothing, it shows the steady labor of winter: heel intact from careful mending, dye mottled in berry streaks, the wool packed smooth along the instep where a foot pressed day after day. Then the story changes—its cuff is stretched from tug-of-war, the toe is frayed with wide pulls, and small punctures align like a mouthful of dog teeth</p>
    <p>Craft notes support a small-batch, home process, even-gauge hand-knitting, natural dye that soaked deeper in darker streaks, and nettle thread where wear was expected. Parallels exist in early settler households.</p>

  <!-- Puppy Teeth -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-puppy-teeth" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Cluster of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Puppy Teeth</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Nov 8, 2026) | Sunken kennel foundation, Site K-3 | Deciduous canine & incisor teeth  in fine loam with spruce-needle traces</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Deciduous canine and incisor crowns composed primarily of hydroxyapatite-rich enamel over dentine with residual root cementum; faint root remnants with soil infill; minimal taphonomic alteration (low micro-pitting).</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Biological remains from natural tooth replacement during puppy development</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 8–12 cm depth within compacted kennel bedding; low-moisture, sheltered context</p>
    <p>A small constellation of teeth marks a brief, busy chapter of puppyhood. Glossy enamel and clean cementum margins indicate gentle in situ deposition into bedding rather than trampling or weathering. The irregular ~6.2 cm scatter matches what you’d expect near a favorite resting spot. Microscopic occlusal and labial micro-striations suggest chewing on fibrous plant material and tiny bones.</p>
    <p>A clump of matted undercoat fur, a short stick worn smooth at both ends from repeated mouthing, and a fragment of woven reed mat likely used as kennel flooring. Comparable modern finds exist, but intact clusters preserved in situ are rare, making this example unusually informative.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Partial Hand -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-hand" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Partial Human Hand and Distal Radius</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Jun 14, 2027) | Cabin Site 7 | Partial metacarpals, proximal phalanges, distal radius (cortical bone)</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Human skeletal elements with preserved microstructure; trace mineral staining from surrounding soil</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Anatomical remains</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 44–52 cm depth beneath the east threshold stone of Cabin Site 7, in compact silty clay; protected, stable temperature and humidity; minimal rodent disturbance</p>
    <p>The assembled curve of these bones suggests a familiar, cupped-hand posture. Along the radial sides of the metacarpals, microscopic polish forms a narrow, repeated track, as though skin and hair passed there countless times. On the distal radius, minute osteoarthritic lipping and subtle remodeling at tendon attachment points indicate decades of gentle flexion–extension rather than high-load labor. Taken together, the pattern fits a low-elevation, forward motion, consistent with stroking or patting a dog.</p>
    <p>The placement under the doorway stone reads as deliberate care in a liminal spot where greeting and parting happen. While occupational stress markers are well documented in weavers, archers, and smiths, this distribution appears distinct, pointing toward affectionate, repetitive contact more than task work.</p>

    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Nov 14, 2029) | Riverbank erosion face, Site E-3 | Cortical bone</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Cortical bone — Dense, compact outer layer of bone composed of hydroxyapatite mineral within a Type I collagen matrix; built to resist bending and torsion.</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Anatomical remains; no evidence of modification for tool use</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Nestled in a shallow silt-and-root alcove.</p>
    <p>A single femur rests where river and forest meet, its surface lightly weathered but intact. Small gnaw marks on the distal epiphysis and faint root etching along the midshaft suggest a quiet sequence: exposure, curiosity from small scavengers, and the slow touch of encroaching roots. The bone lay shielded by overhanging alder, oriented toward the current as if set in a place of notice rather than lost by chance. Found nearby were a smooth river stone with a shallow groove, a length of plaited leather cord frayed as, and a bronze bead of the type seen on Royce-era collar fittings.</p>
    <p>Morphometric measurements align with femora from 25–30 kg Wirehaired Pointing Griffons in regional collections, including confirmed descendants of Royce. Yet caution is essential: without completed dating and broader skeletal association, identity remains unproven. Whether redeposited by shifting banks or placed by human hands, the context suggests remembrance.</p>
