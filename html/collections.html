          <h2>Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h2>
          <p class="meta">Material: Western red cedar body, twisted cedar bark cord, faint traces of spruce resin that still hold a ghost of a forest scent if warmed in the hand.</p>
          <p><b>Size/Weight/Shape:</b> 9.1 cm × 1.6 cm; ~14 g; slender, tapered tube with a whisper-thin mouth opening.</p>
          <p><b>Estimated Age:</b> Precise dating is still under review; the piece is currently undergoing high-resolution stratigraphic scanning and isotope analysis by a joint team of preservation scientists and chronometry specialists to narrow its origin down to the exact year—and possibly even the month—of creation. Estimated Completion Date for Analysis: April 17, 2026.</p>
          <p><b>Preservation State:</b> Complete; cedar shows faint surface checking; cord frayed at the knot as though repeatedly untied and retied in haste.</p>
          <p><b>Location Found:</b> Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2, 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments.</p>
          <p><b>Use and Function:</b> Acoustic signal device.</p>
          <p><b>Likely Purpose:</b> To send precise, far-carrying commands to working dogs navigating open water or weaving through dense reed beds — the sort of whistle a handler could lift without breaking stride.</p>
          <p><b>Evidence of Use:</b> Smooth lip polish on the mouth end; two shallow tooth nicks just below the notch — telltale signs of an eager retriever trying to “help” — and a burnished suspension groove worn glossy from years of swinging at a handler’s side.</p>
          <p><b>Manufacture Clues:</b> Central channel hand-bored; knife-cut notch clean but slightly asymmetrical; lathe-smoothed exterior faintly ridged where the grain resisted.</p>
          <p><b>Found With:</b> Leather strap fragment, copper button stamped with a worn hunting motif, seed husks likely from dockside grain sacks.</p>
          <p><b>Burial or Habitat Context:</b> Collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris — possibly from a shoreline homestead.</p>
          <p><b>Symbolism:</b> While undecorated, the whistle’s plain form suggests it was meant for work, not show — yet to those who know, the first trill after a long day’s hunt can carry as much emotion as any spoken word.</p>
          <p><b>Comparison:</b> Similar in form to rural handmade whistles documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits, though the tooth marks make this one unmistakably personal.</p>

          <h2>Cluster of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Puppy Teeth</h2>
          <p class="meta">Material: Naturally shed deciduous canine and incisor teeth, calcium-rich enamel with faint root remnants; embedded in fine loam with traces of spruce needles.</p>
          <p><b>Size/Weight/Shape:</b> Average tooth length 0.9–1.4 cm; cluster spread ~6.2 cm; total weight ~3.4 g; irregular scatter pattern.</p>
          <p><b>Estimated Age:</b> Precise dating is still under review; the specimen is undergoing micro-layer sediment analysis and trace-element testing in collaboration with veterinary osteologists and paleo-dentists to determine not only the year—but potentially the exact month—these teeth were shed. Estimated Completion Date for Analysis: November 8, 2026.</p>
          <p><b>Preservation State:</b> Exceptional; enamel glossy with minimal micro-pitting; fine soil fill in root hollows; no evidence of post-depositional damage.</p>
          <p><b>Location Found:</b> Edge of a sunken kennel foundation, Site K-3, 8–12 cm depth, within compacted bedding soil.</p>
          <p><b>Use and Function:</b> Biological remains from natural tooth replacement during puppy development.</p>
          <p><b>Likely Purpose:</b> Unintentional deposition; likely lost during play, chewing, or mouthing behavior typical of 3–6 month old pups.</p>
          <p><b>Evidence of Use:</b> Microscopic wear striations suggest chewing on fibrous plant material and small bones; two teeth show faint crescent indentations, possibly from littermate mouthing.</p>
          <p><b>Manufacture Clues:</b> None applicable; naturally formed biological specimens.</p>
          <p><b>Found With:</b> Small clump of matted undercoat fur, fragment of woven reed mat, short stick worn smooth at both ends from repeated mouthing.</p>
          <p><b>Burial or Habitat Context:</b> Low-moisture, sheltered soil beneath former kennel bedding; protected from freeze-thaw cycles, aiding preservation.</p>
          <p><b>Symbolism:</b> To human caretakers, perhaps unnoticed at the time; to the young dog, each shed tooth marked a step toward adulthood and the promise of full hunting days ahead.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle — Exhibit Label</h3>
            <h4>Artifact Facts</h4>
            <p><strong>Artifact ID:</strong> ARC-D2-WHI-001</p>
            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</p>
            <p><strong>Material:</strong> Western red cedar body; twisted cedar-bark cord; faint traces of spruce resin.</p>

            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Material choice. Western red cedar was a practical local wood: light, easy to carve, strong for its weight, and naturally rot- and insect-resistant because of its oils. A twisted cedar-bark cord is common field gear—flexible, quick to knot, and durable when wet. Trace spruce resin on the surface likely acted as a simple sealant or pitch stiffener at the mouth notch; it also helps shed water.</p>
            <p>Why a whistle at all. Working handlers need to direct dogs across distance, wind, and reeds where hand signals and speech fail. A whistle carries farther than a voice, is less tiring, and gives repeatable cues that any trained dog can learn. It also lets a handler keep both hands free for oars, rope, or game.</p>
            <p>How this one was used. Wear patterns are clear: smooth polish at the lip from frequent playing; a glossy suspension groove from long belt or neck carry; and two shallow tooth marks just below the notch from brief canine contact during retrieval or excitement. The tapered tube and hand-bored airway produce a bright, penetrating tone useful over water. The slightly off-center, knife-cut notch favors fast response over decoration—consistent with field use where seconds matter.</p>
            <p>Benefits in the field. Standardized sound codes reduce errors (e.g., “turn,” “hold,” “come”). Dogs hear high pitches well; a small whistle produces those pitches with little breath. The object is cheap to make, easy to repair, and quiet to carry.</p>
            <p>Design and known variants. This example is a simple notched tube: tapered cedar body, single airway, single tone. Regional comparanda include: wood or bone tube whistles (single tone; closest match to this piece); “pea” whistles (wood or metal with a small ball that creates a trill; later/modern); and dual-chamber whistles (two tones for more complex codes; usually later and often metal or plastic). Compared with those, this whistle’s minimalist design is typical of earlier, handmade working gear—durable, easy to keep dry, and loud enough for shoreline work. Context. Associated finds—a leather strap fragment, a copper hunting-motif button, and grain seed husks—fit a provisioning/hunting setting near water. The find layer (collapsed bank with domestic debris) supports ordinary loss rather than ceremonial discard.</p>

            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Dimensions, taper, and notch geometry match handmade Pacific Northwest hunting whistles. This specimen differs by its combined evidence set: (1) paired dental impressions below the notch, (2) deep suspension-groove burnish, and (3) surviving resin traces. Few reference pieces preserve all three, indicating a long, practical service life with a specific handler–dog team rather than generic or unused equipment.</p>

            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Pitch, signal vocabulary, and training routines cannot be reconstructed directly from the object. Non-canine signaling (e.g., to people) is possible but less supported by the context. Absolute dating and cultural assignment remain provisional pending the ongoing stratigraphic and isotope analyses (report expected April 17, 2026). Interpretations may change with new data.</p>

            <p>Dating under review; report expected Sep 3, 2026) | Cabin 1 attic, floorboard cavity. Wear maps handling: polished muzzle, faint hearth-smoke scent, pigment fading on high-contact areas. Context and storage suggest intentional safekeeping rather than discard. Function most consistent with a child’s toy and symbolic stand-in during periods when the working dog was away. Construction techniques—even sinew stitches, uneven hand-cut panels, short pigment strokes to suggest wiry fur—align with home production rather than trade manufacture.</p>

            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Parallels exist in settler-era zoomorphic toys, but Griffon-specific features (muzzle profile, coat texture rendering) indicate a personal model. The survival of both stuffing types (moss and shed undercoat) is comparatively rare and supports the interpretation of intimate household craft.</p>

            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>

Evidence shows two use-phases: first as clothing (even gauge knitting, reinforced stress points, packed fibers at instep), then as canine play object (stretched cuff, wide toe pulls, punctures aligned with teeth, faint muddy paw prints). Dye streaking reflects small-batch natural process.</p>

            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Comparable household textiles are common; clear canine interaction on an otherwise serviceable garment is unusual, offering a domestic snapshot of human–dog relations.</p>

            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Cluster of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Puppy Teeth</p>
            <p><strong>Material:</strong> Deciduous canine/incisor crowns; enamel (hydroxyapatite-rich) over dentine with residual root cementum; fine loam matrix with spruce-needle traces.</p>

            <h4>What the Experts Believe</h4>
            <p>Dating under review; report expected Nov 8, 2026) | Sunken kennel foundation, Site K-3. Glossy enamel with minimal micro-pitting and intact cementum margins indicate gentle in-situ shedding rather than trampling. Scatter (~6.2 cm) matches a resting spot. Micro-striations suggest chewing on fibrous material and small bones. Associated finds—undercoat clump, smoothed mouthing stick, reed-mat fragment—fit kennel bedding context.</p>

            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Intact in-situ clusters are rare; most finds are isolated teeth. This cluster offers a compact record for puppyhood behavior and kennel maintenance practices.</p>

            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Species attribution is supported by morphology and context but remains provisional pending full metrics and trace-element analysis.</p>

Microscopic polish along radial metacarpal margins and subtle osteoarthritic lipping at the distal radius indicate long-term low-force motions consistent with repetitive stroking/patting at low elevation. Context under a threshold—stable temperature/humidity, low disturbance—suggests purposeful placement.</p>

            <h4>Comparative Note</h4>
            <p>Wear differs from occupational markers seen in weaving, archery, or smithing, pointing instead to habitual affectionate contact with animals, likely dogs.</p>

            <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>

  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-whistle" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Apr 17, 2026 | Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2 | Western red cedar with spruce resin</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Western red cedar body; twisted cedar-bark cord; faint traces of spruce resin</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Acoustic signal device (working whistle)</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments; collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris</p>
    <p>This compact cedar whistle reads like a field diary written in wear. The polished mouth end marks where a handler’s lips met wood thousands of times; the two shallow tooth nicks hint at an eager retriever “helping” between casts. A glossy suspension groove shows years of swinging at a hip, ready for a quick trill that cut through wind and reed-rustle. Warmed in the hand, the faint spruce-resin scent still carries a memory of shoreline forest.</p>
    <p>Craft details point to practiced pragmatism: a hand-bored channel for bright, focused tone; a clean, slightly off-center notch that favors speed over ornament. Comparable forms are documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits, yet the tooth marks and specific groove wear make this piece unmistakably personal. As with all sound tools, function is inferred from form and use-wear; interpretation remains provisional until laboratory dating is complete.</p>

    <h2 id="modal-title">Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Doll</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Sep 3, 2026 | Cabin 1 attic, floorboard cavity</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-tanned deerskin panels stitched with sinew; stuffed with dried moss and shed undercoat from a real dog; eyes of polished river stones flecked with mica; detailing in natural ochre and charcoal</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Child’s toy</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Hidden 4 cm below a plank gap in a dry, dust-sealed attic cavity; insulated from temperature swings with minimal insect activity</p>
    <p>Wear on this doll maps the places small hands returned to most: a softened, shiny muzzle; a breath of old hearth smoke woven into the hide. The figure likely stood in for an absent working partner during long hunt days, a portable companion that kept watch from a bedside or tucked pocket. The discovery context, deliberately stowed in a protected floor gap, suggests someone hid it for safekeeping, or for the bittersweet hope of finding it again.</p>
    <p>Craft traces show practiced, loving economy: hand-cut deerskin with uneven edges; neat sinew stitches that still hold in places; short pigment strokes to suggest wiry fur; moss peeking through a seam opened by years of use.</p>

  <!-- Sock -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-sock" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Huckleberry-Dyed Woolen Sock of Joy</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Feb 11, 2027 | Hearthside debris layer, Cabin Site 2</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-spun wool dyed with crushed huckleberry skins and rainwater; toe and heel reinforced with nettle-fiber thread</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Clothing (sock)</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 12–18 cm depth; domestic floor collapse with charred timbers; cool, low-light preservation conditions</p>
    <p>This sock carries two lives in one object. As clothing, it shows the steady labor of winter: heel intact from careful mending, dye mottled in berry streaks, the wool packed smooth along the instep where a foot pressed day after day. Then the story changes—its cuff is stretched from tug-of-war, the toe is frayed with wide pulls, and small punctures align like a mouthful of dog teeth.</p>
    <p>Craft notes support a small-batch, home process—even-gauge hand-knitting, natural dye that soaked deeper in darker streaks, and nettle thread where wear was expected. Parallels exist in early settler households.</p>

  <!-- Puppy Teeth -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-puppy-teeth" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Cluster of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Puppy Teeth</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Nov 8, 2026 | Sunken kennel foundation, Site K-3 | Deciduous canine & incisor teeth in fine loam with spruce-needle traces</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Deciduous canine and incisor crowns composed primarily of hydroxyapatite-rich enamel over dentine with residual root cementum; faint root remnants with soil infill; minimal taphonomic alteration (low micro-pitting).</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Biological remains from natural tooth replacement during puppy development</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 8–12 cm depth within compacted kennel bedding; low-moisture, sheltered context</p>
    <p>A small constellation of teeth marks a brief, busy chapter of puppyhood. Glossy enamel and clean cementum margins indicate gentle in situ deposition into bedding rather than trampling or weathering. The irregular ~6.2 cm scatter matches what you’d expect near a favorite resting spot. Microscopic occlusal and labial micro-striations suggest chewing on fibrous plant material and tiny bones.</p>
    <p>A clump of matted undercoat fur, a short stick worn smooth at both ends from repeated mouthing, and a fragment of woven reed mat likely used as kennel flooring. Comparable modern finds exist, but intact clusters preserved in situ are rare, making this example unusually informative.</p>

  <!-- Partial Hand -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-hand" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Partial Human Hand and Distal Radius</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Jun 14, 2027 | Cabin Site 7 | Partial metacarpals, proximal phalanges, distal radius (cortical bone)</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Human skeletal elements with preserved microstructure; trace mineral staining from surrounding soil</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Anatomical remains</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 44–52 cm depth beneath the east threshold stone of Cabin Site 7, in compact silty clay; protected, stable temperature and humidity; minimal rodent disturbance</p>
    <p>The assembled curve of these bones suggests a familiar, cupped-hand posture. Along the radial sides of the metacarpals, microscopic polish forms a narrow, repeated track, as though skin and hair passed there countless times. On the distal radius, minute osteoarthritic lipping and subtle remodeling at tendon attachment points indicate decades of gentle flexion–extension rather than high-load labor. Taken together, the pattern fits a low-elevation, forward motion, consistent with stroking or patting a dog.</p>
    <p>The placement under the doorway stone reads as deliberate care in a liminal spot where greeting and parting happen. While occupational stress markers are well documented in weavers, archers, and smiths, this distribution appears distinct, pointing toward affectionate, repetitive contact more than task work.</p>

  <!-- Femur -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-femur" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Femur, <em>Canis familiaris</em></h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Nov 14, 2029 | Riverbank erosion face, Site E-3 | Cortical bone</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Cortical bone — Dense, compact outer layer of bone composed of hydroxyapatite mineral within a Type I collagen matrix; built to resist bending and torsion.</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Anatomical remains; no evidence of modification for tool use</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Nestled in a shallow silt-and-root alcove.</p>
    <p>A single femur rests where river and forest meet, its surface lightly weathered but intact. Small gnaw marks on the distal epiphysis and faint root etching along the midshaft suggest a quiet sequence: exposure, curiosity from small scavengers, and the slow touch of encroaching roots. The bone lay shielded by overhanging alder, oriented toward the current as if set in a place of notice rather than lost by chance. Found nearby were a smooth river stone with a shallow groove, a length of plaited leather cord frayed as, and a bronze bead of the type seen on Royce-era collar fittings.</p>
    <p>Morphometric measurements align with femora from 25–30 kg Wirehaired Pointing Griffons in regional collections, including confirmed descendants of Royce. Yet caution is essential: without completed dating and broader skeletal association, identity remains unproven. Whether redeposited by shifting banks or placed by human hands, the context suggests remembrance.</p>
