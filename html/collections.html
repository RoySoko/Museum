          <h2>Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h2>
          <p class="meta">Material: Western red cedar body, twisted cedar bark cord, faint traces of spruce resin that still hold a ghost of a forest scent if warmed in the hand.</p>
          <p><b>Size/Weight/Shape:</b> 9.1 cm × 1.6 cm; ~14 g; slender, tapered tube with a whisper-thin mouth opening.</p>
          <p><b>Estimated Age:</b> Precise dating is still under review; the piece is currently undergoing high-resolution stratigraphic scanning and isotope analysis by a joint team of preservation scientists and chronometry specialists to narrow its origin down to the exact year—and possibly even the month—of creation. Estimated Completion Date for Analysis: April 17, 2026.</p>
          <p><b>Preservation State:</b> Complete; cedar shows faint surface checking; cord frayed at the knot as though repeatedly untied and retied in haste.</p>
          <p><b>Location Found:</b> Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2, 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments.</p>
          <p><b>Use and Function:</b> Acoustic signal device.</p>
          <p><b>Likely Purpose:</b> To send precise, far-carrying commands to working dogs navigating open water or weaving through dense reed beds — the sort of whistle a handler could lift without breaking stride.</p>
          <p><b>Evidence of Use:</b> Smooth lip polish on the mouth end; two shallow tooth nicks just below the notch — telltale signs of an eager retriever trying to “help” — and a burnished suspension groove worn glossy from years of swinging at a handler’s side.</p>
          <p><b>Manufacture Clues:</b> Central channel hand-bored; knife-cut notch clean but slightly asymmetrical; lathe-smoothed exterior faintly ridged where the grain resisted.</p>
          <p><b>Found With:</b> Leather strap fragment, copper button stamped with a worn hunting motif, seed husks likely from dockside grain sacks.</p>
          <p><b>Burial or Habitat Context:</b> Collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris — possibly from a shoreline homestead.</p>
          <p><b>Symbolism:</b> While undecorated, the whistle’s plain form suggests it was meant for work, not show — yet to those who know, the first trill after a long day’s hunt can carry as much emotion as any spoken word.</p>
          <p><b>Comparison:</b> Similar in form to rural handmade whistles documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits, though the tooth marks make this one unmistakably personal.</p>

    <h2 id="modal-title">Hand-Carved Wooden Dog Whistle</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Apr 17, 2026) | Double Lakes bluff, Site D-2 | Western red cedar with spruce resin</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Western red cedar body; twisted cedar-bark cord; faint traces of spruce resin</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Acoustic signal device (working whistle)</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 32–36 cm depth, silty loam dusted with reed fragments; collapsed bank layer mixed with domestic debris</p>
    <p>This compact cedar whistle reads like a field diary written in wear. The polished mouth end marks where a handler’s lips met wood thousands of times; the two shallow tooth nicks hint at an eager retriever “helping” between casts. A glossy suspension groove shows years of swinging at a hip, ready for a quick trill that cut through wind and reed-rustle. Warmed in the hand, the faint spruce-resin scent still carries a memory of shoreline forest</p>
    <p>Craft details point to practiced pragmatism: a hand-bored channel for bright, focused tone; a clean, slightly off-center notch that favors speed over ornament.  Comparable forms are documented in Pacific Northwest hunting kits, yet the tooth marks and specific groove wear make this piece unmistakably personal. As with all sound tools, function is inferred from form and use-wear; interpretation remains provisional until laboratory dating is complete.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Doll -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-doll" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Doll</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Sep 3, 2026) | Cabin 1 attic, floorboard cavity</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-tanned deerskin panels stitched with sinew; stuffed with dried moss and shed undercoat from a real dog; eyes of polished river stones flecked with mica; detailing in natural ochre and charcoal</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Child’s toy</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Hidden 4 cm below a plank gap in a dry, dust-sealed attic cavity; insulated from temperature swings with minimal insect activity</p>
    <p>Wear on this doll maps the places small hands returned to most: a softened, shiny muzzle;  a breath of old hearth smoke woven into the hide. The figure likely stood in for an absent working partner during long hunt days, a portable companion that kept watch from a bedside or tucked pocket. The discovery context, deliberately stowed in a protected floor gap, suggests someone hid it for safekeeping, or for the bittersweet hope of finding it again.</p>
    <p>Craft traces show practiced, loving economy: hand-cut deerskin with uneven edges; neat sinew stitches that still hold in places; short pigment strokes to suggest wiry fur; moss peeking through a seam opened by years of use.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Sock -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-sock" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Huckleberry-Dyed Woolen Sock of Joy</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Feb 11, 2027) | Hearthside debris layer, Cabin Site 2</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-spun wool dyed with crushed huckleberry skins and rainwater; toe and heel reinforced with nettle-fiber thread</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Clothing (sock)</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 12–18 cm depth; domestic floor collapse with charred timbers; cool, low-light preservation conditions</p>
    <p>This sock carries two lives in one object. As clothing, it shows the steady labor of winter: heel intact from careful mending, dye mottled in berry streaks, the wool packed smooth along the instep where a foot pressed day after day. Then the story changes—its cuff is stretched from tug-of-war, the toe is frayed with wide pulls, and small punctures align like a mouthful of dog teeth</p>
    <p>Craft notes support a small-batch, home process, even-gauge hand-knitting, natural dye that soaked deeper in darker streaks, and nettle thread where wear was expected. Parallels exist in early settler households.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Puppy Teeth -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-puppy-teeth" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Cluster of Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Puppy Teeth</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Nov 8, 2026) | Sunken kennel foundation, Site K-3 | Deciduous canine & incisor teeth  in fine loam with spruce-needle traces</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Deciduous canine and incisor crowns composed primarily of hydroxyapatite-rich enamel over dentine with residual root cementum; faint root remnants with soil infill; minimal taphonomic alteration (low micro-pitting).</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Biological remains from natural tooth replacement during puppy development</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 8–12 cm depth within compacted kennel bedding; low-moisture, sheltered context</p>
    <p>A small constellation of teeth marks a brief, busy chapter of puppyhood. Glossy enamel and clean cementum margins indicate gentle in situ deposition into bedding rather than trampling or weathering. The irregular ~6.2 cm scatter matches what you’d expect near a favorite resting spot. Microscopic occlusal and labial micro-striations suggest chewing on fibrous plant material and tiny bones.</p>
    <p>A clump of matted undercoat fur, a short stick worn smooth at both ends from repeated mouthing, and a fragment of woven reed mat likely used as kennel flooring. Comparable modern finds exist, but intact clusters preserved in situ are rare, making this example unusually informative.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Partial Hand -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-hand" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Partial Human Hand and Distal Radius</h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Jun 14, 2027) | Cabin Site 7 | Partial metacarpals, proximal phalanges, distal radius (cortical bone)</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Human skeletal elements with preserved microstructure; trace mineral staining from surrounding soil</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Anatomical remains</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> 44–52 cm depth beneath the east threshold stone of Cabin Site 7, in compact silty clay; protected, stable temperature and humidity; minimal rodent disturbance</p>
    <p>The assembled curve of these bones suggests a familiar, cupped-hand posture. Along the radial sides of the metacarpals, microscopic polish forms a narrow, repeated track, as though skin and hair passed there countless times. On the distal radius, minute osteoarthritic lipping and subtle remodeling at tendon attachment points indicate decades of gentle flexion–extension rather than high-load labor. Taken together, the pattern fits a low-elevation, forward motion, consistent with stroking or patting a dog.</p>
    <p>The placement under the doorway stone reads as deliberate care in a liminal spot where greeting and parting happen. While occupational stress markers are well documented in weavers, archers, and smiths, this distribution appears distinct, pointing toward affectionate, repetitive contact more than task work.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Femur -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-femur" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Femur, <em>Canis familiaris</em></h2>
    <p class="modal-subhead">Dating under review; report expected Nov 14, 2029) | Riverbank erosion face, Site E-3 | Cortical bone</p>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Cortical bone — Dense, compact outer layer of bone composed of hydroxyapatite mineral within a Type I collagen matrix; built to resist bending and torsion.</p>
    <p><strong>Function (Observed):</strong> Anatomical remains; no evidence of modification for tool use</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Nestled in a shallow silt-and-root alcove.</p>
    <p>A single femur rests where river and forest meet, its surface lightly weathered but intact. Small gnaw marks on the distal epiphysis and faint root etching along the midshaft suggest a quiet sequence: exposure, curiosity from small scavengers, and the slow touch of encroaching roots. The bone lay shielded by overhanging alder, oriented toward the current as if set in a place of notice rather than lost by chance. Found nearby were a smooth river stone with a shallow groove, a length of plaited leather cord frayed as, and a bronze bead of the type seen on Royce-era collar fittings.</p>
    <p>Morphometric measurements align with femora from 25–30 kg Wirehaired Pointing Griffons in regional collections, including confirmed descendants of Royce. Yet caution is essential: without completed dating and broader skeletal association, identity remains unproven. Whether redeposited by shifting banks or placed by human hands, the context suggests remembrance.</p>
