        <h2>Dr. Amara Pawlowski</h2>
        <p class="title">Senior Archaeologist, Director of Artifact Retrieval</p>
        <p>Dr. Amara Pawlowski earned her Ph.D. in Archaeology from the University of Edinburgh, with prior field training under the mentorship of Dr. Matías Padillo in the volcanic Rift Valley. Her expertise lies in identifying and preserving ceremonial artifacts tied to interspecies alliance, particularly those involving domesticated canines. A master of both brush and drone, she combines traditional excavation methods with LIDAR scanning to uncover subtle burial outlines and artifact caches. Known for her intuitive excavation style and relentless curiosity, Dr. Pawlowski is most comfortable knee-deep in river silt with a field notebook in one hand and a nose whistle (for communicating with search dogs) in the other.</p>
        <p>At The Museum of Royce the Great, she leads the Artifact Retrieval Unit, curating the “Loyal Tools: Implements of Interdependence” exhibit and overseeing all new field discoveries linked to the Double Lakes Clan. She also mentors the museum’s Youth Digs program, where she’s affectionately nicknamed “Dr. Dirt.”</p>
        <p>Raised by a veterinarian and a cultural geographer, Amara bridges empathy and analysis with ease. Her groundbreaking documentation of the twin riverstone chew idols—unearthed during a triple eclipse dig—earned her the Bronze Paw Award from the International Society of Ritual Canine Studies. She identifies as neurodivergent, attributing her pattern-recognition skills and field sensitivity to her unique cognitive wiring.</p>

        <h2>Dr. Somashekhar G. Houndraman</h2>
        <p class="title">Field Anthropologist, Specialist in Human–Canine Burial Relations</p>
        <p>Dr. Somashekhar G. Houndraman received his doctorate in Biological Anthropology from Jawaharlal Nehru University, with postdoctoral work at the University of Toronto focusing on multispecies osteoarchaeology. Trained in deep-strat excavation and forensic bone mapping, he is known for his meticulous handling of mixed-species burial grounds. Somashekhar blends traditional osteology with thermal imaging and stratigraphic modeling to trace the ceremonial positioning of canine remains. His calm, observant nature—paired with a near-photographic memory for burial patterning—makes him the museum’s go-to expert for interpreting complex human–animal mortuary behavior.</p>
        <p>At The Museum of Royce the Great, Dr. Houndraman leads the study of canine skeletal remains, particularly those connected to ceremonial burials honoring Royce himself. His work centers on decoding how the positioning, adornment, and preservation of these remains reflect the deep reverence ancient communities held for Royce and his descendants. While human remains occasionally appear alongside these burials, Dr. Houndraman views them as narrative frames—essential for understanding the emotional and spiritual impact Royce had on the Double Lakes Clan. He co-leads The Bone Bond Project, which examines these rituals not as simple acts of mourning, but as profound expressions of interspecies kinship, leadership, and legacy.</p>
        <p>Descended from a long line of Tamil herbalists and funeral singers, Dr. Houndraman approaches death not as an end, but a transition worthy of honor. He has authored Silent Paws, Sacred Ground and was awarded the Canine Memory Research Fellowship for his groundbreaking analysis of paw placement in elite burial pits. Fluent in five languages and trained in grief-centered ethnography, he often consults with descendant communities before final interpretations are made.</p>

      <div class="staff-info">
        <h2>Professor Saadhan M. Anandanai</h2>
        <p class="title">Cultural Historian, Analyst of Symbolic Canine Legacies</p>
        <p>Educated at the University of Madras with a focus on Comparative Mythography, Professor Saadhan M. Anandanai later earned his Doctorate in Cultural History at the University of Leiden, where he specialized in interspecies symbolism and postcolonial memory studies. A polyglot and trained folklorist, he applies semiotic analysis, indigenous storytelling frameworks, and oral history interviews to trace the evolving role of dogs within myth, ritual, and public memory.</p>
        <p>At The Museum of Royce the Great, Professor Anandanai serves as the principal interpreter of symbolic canine narratives—particularly those that illuminate the deeper cultural meaning of Royce’s legend. His current work, Whispers Beneath the Furrows, explores the transformation of Royce from living companion to mythic figure, using clan artifacts, ancestral poems, and burial iconography to map how stories preserve power, grief, and reverence. He collaborates frequently with performance artists and community elders to create immersive, emotionally resonant exhibits.</p>
        <p>Raised among coastal Tamil griots and trained in both classical Sangam literature and structural anthropology, Professor Anandanai believes that truth resides in layered meaning. He is known for his meditative presence, ceremonial shawls, and his quiet questioning of museum authority itself. Whether drafting exhibit scripts or conducting interviews beside ancestral rivers, he views his role not as a narrator of facts—but as a translator of longing, loyalty, and love.</p>
